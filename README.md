# 🧠 Brain Disease Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of brain diseases based on medical parameters and patient data.

---

## 📘 Overview
This project uses data science and machine learning algorithms to detect possible brain-related diseases by analyzing various input factors. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and medical decision-making.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- Flask (for the web interface)  
- HTML, CSS (for front-end UI)

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes parameters such as:
- Age  
- Gender  
- MRI scan data or medical test values  
- Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Family medical history  
- Other neurological indicators

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed using Pandas and NumPy.  
2. The model is trained using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).  
3. Flask is used to integrate the model into a web-based application.  
4. The user inputs medical details on the web page, and the system predicts the probability of a brain disease.

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add more medical datasets for better accuracy.  
- Integrate with live MRI data using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Deploy the app on cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS.
